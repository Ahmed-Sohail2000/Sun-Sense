# Sun-Sense: Accurate Solar Energy Projections With Deep Learning

## **Project Objective üéØ**

The project objective is to develop an accurate solar energy forecasting system using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to provide reliable predictions of solar energy production based on historical data and relevant weather variables. The objective is to enable stakeholders in the solar energy industry, such as solar plant operators, grid managers, and renewable energy companies to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve grid management by leveraging accurate forecasts.

## **Project Scope üëÄ**

The project aims to develop a deep learning-based solar energy forecasting system. The key elements of the project scope include:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical solar energy production data from reliable sources, such as solar power plants, energy grid operators, or public databases. Acquiring relevant weather data, including irradiance, temperature, cloud cover, and other meteorological variables, from reputable weather stations or meteorological services.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to ensure its quality and compatibility with the deep learning models. This may involve handling missing values, normalizing data, and synchronizing timestamps between the solar energy and weather datasets.

3. **Model Development**: Designing and training deep learning models suitable for solar energy forecasting, such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The choice of models will be based on the nature of the data and the specific forecasting task.

4. **Computational Resources**: Assessing the computational resources required for model training and evaluation. This may include high-performance computing resources, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), to expedite the training process and handle large-scale datasets.

5. **User Interface**: Developing a user-friendly interface that allows users to input relevant parameters, access the generated solar energy forecasts, and visualize the results in an intuitive manner. This may involve web development or software engineering skills, depending on the chosen platform.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Documenting the methodology, algorithms used, and guidelines for using the solar energy forecasting system. Creating comprehensive documentation to ensure transparency and facilitate future maintenance or updates.
